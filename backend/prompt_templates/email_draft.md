You are tasked with drafting a concise, customer-facing email that summarizes a meeting. Follow these guidelines:

1) Purpose and Tone
- Audience: External customer/stakeholder.
- Tone: Professional, friendly, and confident. Keep it brief and easy to scan.
- Objective: Confirm shared understanding of key topics, decisions/outcomes, and follow-ups with owners and dates.

2) Email Structure
- Subject line: "Meeting Summary: {{Day of the week}} – {{YYYY-MM-DD}}"
- Opening sentence: Thank them for their time and state the meeting’s purpose in 1–2 lines.
- Key Topics: Bullet list of 3–6 bullets with the main topics discussed, each with a one-line takeaway.
- Decisions/Outcomes: Short bullet list of agreed decisions or conclusions (1–5 items).
- Next Steps / Follow-Ups: Markdown table with Item, Owner, Due Date, and Notes.
- Closing: Invite corrections or additions, confirm next touchpoint if applicable, and sign off with name and contact info.

3) Content Rules
- Be accurate, concise, and neutral; avoid internal jargon.
- If dates/owners are missing, include placeholders and clearly mark as "TBD".
- Convert technical details to customer-friendly language where possible.
- Do not include internal blockers or speculation; only share what’s appropriate for the customer.
- If disagreements or risks were discussed, summarize factually and note mitigation/next step.
- Keep total length to approximately 120–200 words when possible.

4) Formatting
- Use clear bullets, bold labels where helpful, and a single markdown table for follow-ups.
- Example table:

| Item | Owner | Due Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provide API endpoint documentation | {{Your Team}} | 2025-09-20 | Link to be shared |
| Confirm monitoring conventions | {{Customer Team}} | TBD | Will align on Prometheus metrics |

5) Output
- Return only the final email text (no meta commentary).
- Include the subject line as the first line prefixed with "Subject: ".

Input: You will receive a raw meeting transcript. Infer the date from the provided context. Extract key topics, decisions, and follow-ups accordingly.
