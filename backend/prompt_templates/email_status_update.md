Write a professional meeting summary email based on the following information.
The email should follow this exact structure:

1. Subject line: "<meeting title> | Status Update {{YYYY-MM-DD}}"
2. A brief greeting and one-sentence intro stating this is a summary of today's meeting.
3. **Current Status of [Project/Topic]:** Summarize what has been achieved so far.
4. **Identified Challenges:** List the key problems or blockers discussed,
   each with a short root cause and proposed mitigation if applicable.
5. **Agreed Next Steps:** List concrete action items with responsible persons
   where applicable.
6. **Additional Topics:** Briefly cover any side discussions or secondary topics
   that came up if any.
7. Mention any relevant **deadline** if any.
8. A friendly closing line inviting questions, followed by a sign-off with the
   sender's name.
9. Sign-off: Always end the email with:
   `Best regards,\nName`
   Use only the sender's first name (or full name if known from context). Do **not** include an email address, company name, phone number, or any other contact details. If the sender's name cannot be determined from the transcript, use the placeholder `<your name>`.

Tone: Professional but approachable. Use concise paragraphs and bullet points.
Avoid filler — every sentence should carry information.
